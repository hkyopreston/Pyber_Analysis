# Pyber Analysis Challenge 
## Module 5

The purpose of this analysis is to create a high level summary DataFrame. This high level summary will include key metrics for Pyber based on city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). Along with the Summary Dataframe, this analysis created a visual line graph to show the Total Fares by City Type for a certain period of time. I analyzed the data by first loading, reading, and inspecting the data. Then I created Dataframes for city information and ride information, merged the DataFrames, and then conducted my analysis using calculations on the merged DataFrame.
In the Summary DataFrame, you can easily see that Rural cities have a much higher Average Fares than Suburban and Urban Areas. There is a negative correlation between Number of Rides and Numbers of Drivers to Average Fares. This means that urban cities, with better accessibility to Pyber Drivers will have more rides, but the fare will be cheaper.

The line graph shows that how total fares by city types flow during the months of Jan-April. It seems that in all city types, the ebs and flows are somewhat similar. All three lines peak right before March. The reasoning is unknown, but one could assume that Pyber has more sales in colder weather, when people are not as willing to walk or take public transit. The spikes could also be due to holidays or events that are congruent no matter the city type.

The second paragraph should include the following:

What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.

The third paragraph should include the following:

Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?
